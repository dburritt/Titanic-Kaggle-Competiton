# Project proposal for Kagle Competition - Titanic dataset
Author: Drew Burritt

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
I would like to participate in a Kaggle competition and see how topics covered in class can be applied to other datasets.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
-Create a Kaggle account
-I have chosen the Titanic classification problem as it is one of the recommended datasets.
-I will use lab3 as a template.
-Submit solution on Kaggle
-If I have time, I will either try a second dataset or explore other classifiers.


## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
Template - Lab3 notebook
Classifiers - Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, SVC, BernoulliNB, BernoulliNB
